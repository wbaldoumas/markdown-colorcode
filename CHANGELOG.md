This release includes several breaking changes. See the details below for more info.

### Changed

The `UseColorCode` `MarkdownPipelineBuilder` extension method has been changed to take in additional optional parameters. These are:

| Parameter | Default | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `htmlFormatterType` | `HtmlFormatterType.Style` | The HTML formatter type to use. Supports inline style-based (default) or CSS class-based code colorization. |
| `styleDictionary` | `StyleDictionary.DefaultDark` | The code colorization style to use. |
| `additionalLanguages` | `null` | Additional languages to augment the built-in languages provided by ColorCode-Universal. |
| `defaultLanguageId` | `null` | A default language ID to use if the language at hand can't be found within the languages provided by ColorCode-Universal (or the `additionalLanguages` which have augmented them). The default language will also be used if no language is provided for the given code block.

### Removed

- Removed the `UseColorCodeWithClassStyling` `MarkdownPipelineBuilder` extension method. If you were previously using this, pass `HtmlFormatterType.Css` to the `UseColorCode` extension method to define the same behavior.
- Various classes have been made `internal` to reduce the footprint of this package.
